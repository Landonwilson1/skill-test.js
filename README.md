  ## Challenges
 Overall the project was mostly straightforward. I decided to challenge myself by using react.js to build the application. Using axios with react to fetch the data from the API took me a while to understand entirely. Once I was able to access all the data from the API the process became manageable. However, the data within the api was difficult to destructure. Having only some causes with data for City and State made it difficult to test. Lastly, I enjoyed the challenge of completing this project within a time limit. It was a true test of my knowledge on react and APIâ€™s. I was able to create a simple yet intriguing UI from the Givebacks Cause Search API with minimal loading times.
